\chapter{MATLAB Basics}
In this appendix we'll go through a few of the basics in MATLAB.  This is by no means
meant to be an all-encompassing resource for MATLAB programming.  A few more thorough
resources are listed here.

In this appendix we'll give examples of some of the more common coding practices that the
reader will run into while working through the exercises and problems in these notes.
